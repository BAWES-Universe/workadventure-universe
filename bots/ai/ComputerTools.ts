/**
 * A Brick's computer in its owner's chat (game #2000), on the bot server.
 *
 * `use_computer` starts a job on the Brick's own computer. It is the LAST way: an app that can do the job is used instead and wakes
 * nothing, and reading a page is `read_web_page`, never a computer. The tool is only offered when Orbit says the computer is on for
 * this person, so choosing it never wakes anything by itself: waking happens when Orbit starts the job, and only for the owner.
 * What the model is told for each way a start can go is one plain line to say, in the person's language, in the words of the mock
 * (Part 12): a second job waits its turn, a resting computer wakes, a broken one says so, a restored one says which day.
 * No count, no price, no provider or machine name ever reaches the model, so none reaches the chat.
