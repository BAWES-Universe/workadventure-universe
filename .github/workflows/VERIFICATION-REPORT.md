# GitHub Actions Workflow Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-12-01  
**Branch:** universe  
**Repository:** BAWES-Universe/workadventure-universe

## ✅ Verification Complete

### 1. Workflow Files Verified ✓

- ✅ `build-universe-images.yml` - Build workflow exists and is correctly configured
- ✅ `test-universe-images.yml` - Test workflow exists and correctly references build workflow
- ✅ Fixed: Test workflow now uses branch name tag instead of always "latest"

### 2. Dockerfile.universe Files Verified ✓

All required Dockerfile.universe files exist:
- ✅ `play/Dockerfile.universe`
- ✅ `back/Dockerfile.universe`
- ✅ `map-storage/Dockerfile.universe`
- ✅ `uploader/Dockerfile.universe`

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration Verified ✓

- ✅ `contrib/docker/docker-compose.universe.yaml` exists
- ✅ All 4 services (play, back, map-storage, uploader) are referenced
- ✅ Image naming convention is correct: `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER}/${service}-universe:${VERSION}`

### 4. Workflow Components Verified ✓

**Build Workflow:**
- ✅ Triggers on push to `universe` branch (with path filters)
- ✅ Supports manual workflow_dispatch
- ✅ Builds all 4 services in parallel
- ✅ Uses correct Dockerfile paths (`./${service}/Dockerfile.universe`)
- ✅ Pushes to GHCR with correct image names
- ✅ Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds

**Test Workflow:**
- ✅ Triggers automatically after build workflow completes successfully
- ✅ Uses `workflow_run` trigger correctly
- ✅ Uses branch name tag from triggering workflow (fixed)
- ✅ Runs WorkAdventure's existing test suite
- ✅ Uses docker-compose.universe.yaml to override images
- ✅ Runs tests in 2 shards (parallel execution)

### 5. Image Naming Convention Verified ✓

All images follow the correct naming pattern:
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/play-universe:universe`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/play-universe:universe-<sha>`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/back-universe:universe`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/back-universe:universe-<sha>`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/map-storage-universe:universe`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/map-storage-universe:universe-<sha>`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/uploader-universe:universe`
- `ghcr.io/BAWES-Universe/uploader-universe:universe-<sha>`

### 6. Alignment with WorkAdventure Best Practices ✓

The workflows follow WorkAdventure's established patterns:

1. **Reuses Existing Test Infrastructure:**
   - ✅ Uses `docker-compose.prod.yaml` (WorkAdventure's production setup)
   - ✅ Uses `tests/docker-compose.test.yaml` (WorkAdventure's test overrides)
   - ✅ Runs `npm run test-single-domain-install` (WorkAdventure's test command)
   - ✅ Uses Playwright test suite from WorkAdventure

2. **Follows WorkAdventure's Build Patterns:**
   - ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds
   - ✅ Uses GitHub Actions cache
   - ✅ Proper build arguments handling
   - ✅ Correct image tagging strategy

3. **Non-Intrusive Setup:**
   - ✅ Uses `.universe` suffix for custom files (no conflicts with upstream)
   - ✅ Only runs on `universe` branch (doesn't interfere with upstream)
   - ✅ Uses separate workflow files (no conflicts with WorkAdventure workflows)

## 📋 Scripts Created

Three verification and monitoring scripts have been created:

1. **`scripts/verify-github-workflows.sh`**
   - Verifies all workflow files and configurations
   - Checks Dockerfile.universe files exist
   - Validates docker-compose configuration
   - Confirms workflow components are correct

2. **`scripts/trigger-and-verify-workflow.sh`**
   - Creates a test commit to trigger workflow
   - Pushes to trigger GitHub Actions
   - Provides workflow monitoring information

3. **`scripts/monitor-workflow-and-verify.sh`**
   - Monitors workflow status (if GitHub CLI is installed)
   - Verifies images exist in GHCR
   - Provides comprehensive status report

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Verification

Since direct push requires authentication, complete the verification by:

1. **Push the commits:**
   ```bash
   git push origin universe
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/BAWES-Universe/workadventure-universe/actions
   - Wait for "Build Universe Images for Coolify" to complete
   - Verify "Test Universe Images" runs automatically after build succeeds

3. **Verify images in GHCR:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/BAWES-Universe?tab=packages
   - Or run: `./scripts/monitor-workflow-and-verify.sh`

4. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ All 4 images built and pushed to GHCR
   - ✅ Images tagged with `universe` and `universe-<sha>`
   - ✅ Test workflow runs and passes
   - ✅ Images are ready for deployment in Coolify

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

1. **Test Workflow Tag Fix:**
   - Changed from always using `latest` tag
   - Now uses branch name (`universe`) from triggering workflow
   - Ensures test workflow uses correct image tags

## ✨ Summary

**Status:** ✅ All workflow configurations verified and correct  
**Ready for:** Push to trigger workflow and verify images  
**Compliance:** ✅ Follows WorkAdventure's best practices  
**Non-Intrusive:** ✅ No conflicts with upstream WorkAdventure code

The workflow setup is complete and ready for use. Once pushed, the workflows will:
1. Build all 4 services automatically
2. Push images to GHCR
3. Run comprehensive tests
4. Verify everything works correctly
